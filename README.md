m a PhD researcher at [University Name] specializing in criminology and cybersecurity. My research examines criminal methodologies within digital and physical spaces — including cyberattacks, online narcotics markets, fraud, social engineering, and financial obfuscation techniques. The purpose of this work is to contribute to the development of better defense, detection, and intervention strategies. I will be undertaking several interdisciplinary projects involving threat modeling and behavioral analysis. I’m looking for ongoing technical assistance in understanding and replicating these tactics in simulated, controlled research environments to support defensive tooling and criminological analysis.
